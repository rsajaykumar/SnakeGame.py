# SnakeGame.py
A snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves across the screen and eats food items, 
growing in size as it eats. The objective is to eat as much food as possible while avoiding collision with the walls or the snake's own body. 
The game typically increases in difficulty as the snake grows longer, requiring the player to navigate tight spaces and avoid obstacles. 
The game ends if the snake crashes into a wall or runs into its own tail.
